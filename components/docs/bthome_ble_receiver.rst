ESP32 BTHome Receiver
=====================

**BTHome** is an energy efficient but flexible BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) format for devices to 
broadcast their sensor data and  button presses. Devices can run over a year on a single battery.
It allows data encryption and is supported by popular home automation platforms, 
like `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io>`__, out of the box.

This component implements local reception and decoding without the need of a central hub.

Note: as for now this component is limited to V1 and V2 unencryted formats.
Encryption support might be implemented later on.

.. _bthome-component:

Component/Hub
-------------

The ``bthome_ble_receiver`` component creates a global hub so that you can track bluetooth low
energy devices using your ESP32 node over the BTHome protocol using both v1 and v2 protocols.

The component depends on the ``esp32_ble_tracker`` component which needs to be added to the 
configuration.

The bthome receiver component is an internal model that acts as a central reception 
and dispatcher hub to which bthome virtual devices and sensors are connected to.

.. _config-bthome:

Configuration variables:
************************

- **dump** (*Optional*): Decode and dumpincoming remote readings codes in the logs 
  (at log.level=DEBUG) for any device.
  
  - **all**: Decode and dump all readings.
  - **unmatched**: Decode and dump readings that are not mapped in configuration.
  - **none**: (default) Decode but do not dump any readings.

- **id** (*Optional*): Manually specify the ID for this Hub.

- **devices** (*Optional*): List of remote devices connected to this hub. Any devices not specified here, but only in sensor sections will use default settings.

  - **mac_address** (**Required**, mac-address): The address of the sensor.

  - **name_prefix** (*Optional*): Device name to append before any sensor name as a prefix.

  - **dump** (*Optional*): Decode and dump incoming remote readings codes in the logs 
    (at log.level=DEBUG) for this device.


.. _bthome-sensor:

Sensor and Binary Sensor as *virtual device*
--------------------------------------------

The bthome sensor allows you use a sensor to display received measurement from a remote 
BTHome device.
First, you need to define a :ref:`bthome hub component <bthome-component>`.

The bthome sensor component (or "device") is an internal model that acts as a central reception 
and dispatcher hub for a specific remote device identified by a ``mac_address`` to which bthome 
sensors are connected to.

To initialize a sensor, first supply ``mac_address`` to identify the remote BTHome device.

- **sensors** (*Required*): List of remote sensor connected to this virtual device.
  
  - **name** (*Optional*): The name for the sensor. At least one of **id** and **name** must be specified.

  - **measurement_type** (*Required*, int **or** string): Measurement type as defined in 
    `BTHome format specification <https://bthome.io/format>`__ either as a string or a numeric value. 
    If selected by name (string) the accuracy and unit of measurement are automatically defaulted to the 
    correct values.
    
    Measurement type `further details <bthome_common_format.rst>`__ to be taken into account.
